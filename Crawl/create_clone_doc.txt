#Written by: Jayson scruggs


Creating a clone will require access to the server through a desktop client.

To create a clone, login in through the client.

  1. Select the host

  3. Right-click datastore1
  4. Select browse datastore
  5. Click the create new folder button and name your folder appropriately {preferably by ip address}
  6. Enter the clone folder and copy the .vmx and .vmdk files {you will need to right-click to do this}
  7. Paste these files into the folder you created {again you will need to right-click}
  8. right-click the .vmx file and add to inventory {this will take a minute}
  9. Power on the machine and at the prompt select "I copied it" {This may work best in the web-client}
